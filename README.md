# MATS

This is the repository for the Multilingual Analogy Test Set, made available along our *SEM 2023 paper _„Mann“ is to “Donna” as「国王」is to « Reine »: Adapting the Analogy Task for Multilingual and Contextual Embeddings_. It's based on the original BATS dataset from Gladkova et al. (2016), which you can find [here](https://vecto.space/projects/BATS/).

The dataset spans six languages (Dutch, French, German, Italian, Mandarin, Spanish). All the data is available in the `dataset/` directory. Each language has its own subdirectory; language-specific directories follow the same structure as the original BATS dataset.

This repository also contains the scripts used in our experiments. They are mainly provided for documentation and replicability purposes.
